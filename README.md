# [Nguyen Thu An Le] – Data & Analytics Portfolio

## About

Hello, I'm Nguyen Thu An Le, a 4th-year Economics and Data Analytics student at the Wilfrid Laurier University, graduating in 2026. I’m passionate about leveraging data and econometric methods to uncover insights that inform business and policy decisions. My academic background and project work have given me experience in Python, R, SQL, and data visualization tools.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new analytics techniques, exploring open data, and building data-driven stories that matter.
